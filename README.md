# Movie-Correlation-Project


Is the movie industry dying? is Netflix the new entertainment king? Those were the first questions that led to the creation of a dataset focused on movie revenue and analyze it over the last decades. But, why stop there? There are more factors that intervene in this kind of thing, like actors, genres, user ratings and more. And now, anyone with experience (you) can ask specific questions about the movie industry, and get answers.
The dataset is gotten from kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies
